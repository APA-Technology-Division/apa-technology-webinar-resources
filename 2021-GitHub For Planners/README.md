# [GitHub For Planners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVa4d728T0k)
Many existing trends of digitalization in planning have been accelerated during the pandemic. The importance of software and data in planning have taken a new meaning as cities look to do everything from leveraging AI to managing their curbs. When we hear "Data is the new oil" or "Code is the new concrete", understanding how the refineries and mixers operate might be a good idea. GitHub is a widely used distributed collaboration platform in the tech industry, as a tool for knowledge sharing, software development,  and collaboration. David Wasserman, Data Science Practice Lead at Alta Planning & Design and Marshall Ballard, Associate at Fehr & Peers, will provide some background information on Git & GitHub and how planners can use them through a short demo of APA Technology Division's new planning-technology-resources Github Repository and how you can get involved.
