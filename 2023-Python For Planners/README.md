# [Python For Planners](https://www.nyplanning.org/events/python-for-planners/)

“Python for Planners” is an upcoming virtual workshop targeting urban planning professionals. The event aims to demonstrate the applicability of Python, a robust programming language, to address common data-related challenges in urban planning.
Urban planning is increasingly data-driven, and Python presents a potent resource for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. At this event, urban planners already using Python will share their experiences, showcasing how they’ve utilized this powerful tool to enhance their planning strategies and decision-making processes.

The workshop also includes an interactive Python introduction designed specifically for urban planners. Far from a technical deep dive, this session provides a user-friendly overview of Python, focusing on practicality over complexity. Participants will gain an understanding of Python’s capabilities in their context, starting with straightforward scripting and progressing to managing large datasets and creating impactful visualizations.

“Python for Planners” is not merely an informational session—it’s an opportunity to explore a new professional resource. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a clearer picture of what Python is and how it can be employed effectively in urban planning. The event aims to eliminate any preconceived intimidation, fostering confidence in participants to adopt Python as a valuable asset in their professional arsenal.

Join us for “Python for Planners” to learn, interact, and discover how Python can enhance your urban planning approach. This workshop sets out to bridge the gap between urban planning and Python, setting you on a path to make more data-informed decisions. We look forward to engaging with you on this educational journey.
